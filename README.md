# KPMG-Capstone-Deep-Learning-Flood-Classification
## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a model to detect signs of flooding in one geography with satellite images using computer vision technology.
## Roadmap
1. Collect and preprocess satellite image data from Planet.
2. Apply CNN architecture to classify the image as flood and nonflood.
3. Apply the business case into the model created and access the economic value.
